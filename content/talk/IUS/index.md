summary: I will be addressing how regularly testing ourselves is a better learning strategy than others, such as reading the material over and over again.
abstract: "An efficient learning strategy is the single most important possession in our academic life. But how do we decide which strategy is better to use? Not surprisingly, there is a growing body of research on this question."
