abstract = "<p> ver since the idea of hierarchy within visual cortex was introduced, researchers used this framework to explain category selective areas which tend to appear in pairs. According to this, earlier regions were responsible from processing basic information like spatial location, whereas later areas were involved in more complex processing such as category selectivity. Thus, there was a dichotomy in which posterior areas had retinotopic organization while anterior areas had functional specialization. However, recent studies argued that visual cortex may not have such a strict hierarchy; higher-order regions might contain some low-level information and vice versa. This study aims to reveal the interaction between the two representations which are retinotopy and category selectivity, and the position of the regions which are posterior and anterior. Specifically, it explores if these representations are independent from one another as often suggested. To test this, participants were presented with face and scene stimuli on left and right visual fields separately, and the response in face- and scene-selective in both positions were observed. Results revealed an interactive organisation between earlier and later areas in which retinotopy persist through higher-order areas as well as category-selectivity while category-selectivity is seen in earlier regions along with retinotopy, supporting the latter perspective. </p>"
