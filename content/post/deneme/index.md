Deciding on a learning strategy without help can be a complex procedure. Learners are expected to increase their knowledge autonomously, initiate the learning, go through the material and understand its contents. Efficient learning is only viable if the learner has the skills to initiate the learning, and afterwards manage its processing and storage. These are known as learning strategies in the education field. An efficient learning strategy is the single most important possession in our academic life. Not surprisingly, there is a growing body of research on this question; which learning strategies are more useful than others?
Positive effects of testing the memory is studied for exactly a century now. These researches predominantly agree on testing actually help us learn better by keeping us motivated. Yet, many people believe over-testing children can have detrimental effects like anxiety. According to Dr. David Shanks, these complaints are based on the assumption that the main reason of testing is to assess the knowledge. Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Brain Sciences at University College London, Dr. Shanks have dedicated his life in human learning and memory research. At an invited talk at University of Edinburgh, he explained why taking regularly testing ourselves is a better learning strategy than others, like just reading the material.

# Why testing help us learn better?

Expectation of interim tests simply help us maintain our focus and motivation while studying. Shanksâ€™s experiments, participants were asked to study Swahili translations of English words. Participants decided how much time they will allocate for studying the material. Both Interim and No-Interim groups knew that they will receive a final test, however they didn't know if they will receive an interim exam after studying each material.
