Deciding on a learning strategy without help can be a complex procedure. Efficient learning is only viable if the learner has the skills to initiate the learning autonomusly, and afterwards manage its processing and storage. These are known as learning strategies in the education field. An efficient learning strategy is the single most important possession in our academic life. But how do we decide which strategy is better to use? Not surprisingly, there is a growing body of research on this question.


Positive effects of testing the memory is studied for exactly a century now. These researches predominantly agree on testing actually help us learn better by keeping us motivated. Yet, many people believe over-testing children can have detrimental effects like anxiety. According to Dr. David Shanks, these complaints are based on the assumption that the main reason of testing is to assess the knowledge. Deputy Dean of the Faculty of Brain Sciences at University College London, Dr. Shanks have dedicated his life in human learning and memory research. [**During an invited talk at University of Edinburgh**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWCWnqLmTuo), he explained why regularly testing ourselves is a better learning strategy than others, such as  reading the material over and over again.

&nbsp;


# Why testing help us learn better?

Expectation of interim tests simply help us maintain our focus and motivation while studying. For the first experiment of Dr. Shank, participants were asked to study Swahili translations of English words. Participants decided how much time they will allocate for studying the material. Both Interim and No-Interim groups knew that they will receive a final test, however they didn't know if they will receive an interim exam after studying each material.

_Figure 1 Illustrates the general design of the studies. Students were divided into two groups. In the first study, first group only studied the material while the second group received a test at the end of their study session. Math tests are used as control condition in all experiments._

&nbsp;


In the beginning, both Interim and No-Interim groups allocated the same amount of time to study the material. However, while the participants that has been tested regularly kept their motivation and effort on the same level over time, the group that have not been tested until the List 5 gradually reduced their effort.

_Figure 2 Depicts the results of the first study. Interim group maintains their motivation while No-Interim group loses the motivation over time._

&nbsp;


Additionally, Shanks found out that Interim group was able to remember twice as much of the No-Interim group. This is because anticipating an exam keeps our motivation at a high level. Motivation is a source that governs and maintains our behaviour. It consists goals, thus calls for action. Goals supply us the incentive for action whilst action requires individuals to make effort. In the essence, this is what leads us to maintain our focus for extended period of time. In return, these individuals succeed so they can ‘have some kind of reward or abstain from the punishment’, such as receiving good or bad grades. This is just one example among many similar findings. It is not very surprising that taking tests can enhance the retention of that particular material. What is quite unexpected is that doing so can also enhance the memorising and retention of different information in the same domain. For instance, studying correlation analysis for statistics exam also help us learn regression in the future. Dr. Shanks’s main interest lays on this phenomenon which is called ‘forward testing effect’.

In his next study, Dr. Shanks and his colleagues used face and name pairs while leaving the design as it was on Swahili-English word pairs. Researchers preferred this material in order to confirm that benefits of testing are not limited to one type of study material. This time, they found that Interim group steadily increased their allocation of time instead of keeping it the same across lists. In addition, they had less proactive interference than No-Interim group, which refers to mistakenly recalling words from previous lists. On the other hand, No-Interim group decrease their effort over time. As result, participants who took Interim tests got better results after each test.

&nbsp;


Increase in time allocation is just an effect of the material. When we meet someone new, it is challenging to keep their faces and names in mind. If we anticipate that we will be tested, it is only rational to spare more time for remembering this information. But how can we make sure that obtaining better results is not an effect of simply spending more time to memorise it? Shanks and his colleagues designed another study in order to clear up this question. This time, duration of studying was set the same for both groups. However, Interim group still maintained the amount of recall across the lists. They also remembered twice as much in the cumulative test as No-Interim group. Thus, researchers concluded that getting better results is related to the testing effect rather than the duration of a study session.

_Figure 4 Shows the results of face-name pair study. Interim group remembered twice as much pairs than No-Interim group in the final test._

&nbsp;


By receiving tests regularly, students gain experience about how difficult these tests are. Thus, tests prompt students to evaluate their learning strategies and find more efficient ways to learn. This is where **metacognition** comes into the picture. Metacognition refers to knowing when and how to use strategies in order to learn better. Researchers explored if participants are aware that in absence of testing, learning will be reduced at the end of each list. And if they are aware that when tested regularly, they will maintain their rate of learning across the lists. At the end of each list researchers asked all the participants to evaluate how many items they think they can remember if they received a test. Consequently, participants who did not receive interim test diminished their confidence rating much more than those who received tests. This is particularly important because metacognition requires effective control of motivation, therefore it can enhance the persistence at challenging tasks. Utilising a strategy to overcome challenges requires a lot of effort and consumes significant amount of time. Thus, it is known to be a good indicator of students’ engagement in the material and their performances in class. What we know from behavioural studies is that highly motivated students will carry on even the task is very challenging, whilst students with low motivation tend to diminish their effort in the same condition.

# Which other types of learning are susceptible to forward learning effect?

Forward learning effect can be seen in learning abstract concepts as well. Shanks and his team explored if this effect is limited to low-level learning like ‘facts’, or is it also extending to high-level ones like ‘inductive learning’. This is a type of learning in which individuals generalise their prior experiences when making inferences about anything that cannot benefit from direct experience. The same experimental design with prior studies was used, with anaddition of Re-study Group to the Interim and No-Interim groups. Also, this time the material was Renaissance paintings, which requires abstract thinking unlike word pairs. Participants were asked to study 20 paintings and their artists, like Botticelli and Caravaggio.

Later on, they were shown different paintings, and were asked to classify these according to which artist they belong to. In the cumulative test, Interim group scored higher than both No-Interim and Re-study group.
Forward testing effect is also seen in ‘transfer of learning’, where participants study English-Swahili word pairs and are tested on something completely different like face-name pairs.

# Learning from the Mistakes

Research that is conducted by Shanks and his colleagues related to errorful generation provides some evidence that people learn better by trial and error. Participants were either asked to read and memorise word translations or presented with a Swahili-word and asked to make a guess right away. As result, the group who made wrong guesses and got corrected afterwards scored higher than the group who only studied the material.

_Figure 5 Shows the grade that groups received in Generate and Read conditions. Participants who generated an errorful answer instead of studying the material scored higher in the final test._

&nbsp;


Interestingly, participants do not seem to get confused by the error that they generate. Rather than remembering their incorrect reply, they are able to provide the actual answer.
Other studies demonstrated that when students are very confident on their wrong answer, they are more likely to remember the correct answer after they have been corrected. Researchers theorized that when the students strongly believe that their answer is correct, they pay more attention to corrective feedbacks. Element of surprise might also be effective in remembering such moments. A well-known phenomenon in cognitive psychology claims that we remember events better if it consists novel moments.
