A few months ago, I started to learn how to create a blog using R Markdown from scracth. Initially, I knew very little about Markdown, and I had absolutely no idea about HTML or CSS. Right after launching my own blog, I came across with the <a href = "https://datasciencebox.org/hello-world.html" bookdown website of Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel> and saw some really cute colorful boxes there. It seemed like a great way to highlight important information, so I started searching for the code of these colorful boxes.

<style>
div.yellow {
    background-image: url("note.png");
}
</style>

<div class = "yellow">
An example note box.
</div>
