I am a Clinical Psychologist & Neuropsychologist. Currently I work as a research assistant at Middle East Technical University. I am interested in exploring the ways we utilize our sensory system to perceive the world, vision in particular. I am hoping to explore the visual cortex of visually impaired people in the future.
