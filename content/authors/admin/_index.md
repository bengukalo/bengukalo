   <p style="text-align:left;"> I have a background in Cognitive Neuropsychology and Clinical Psychology. Currently I work as a research assistant at Middle East Technical University, Sensory Processes Lab. I am interested in exploring the ways we utilize our sensory system to perceive the world, vision in particular. </p>
